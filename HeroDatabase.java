Counterspell reduces much of the damage from Dispersion and Radiance. Anti-Mage usually builds a Manta Style, preventing Spectre from dealing any Desolate damage to him once he summons his illusions.", "[Storm Spirit]: Because of the high mana cost of Ball Lightning, Storm Spirit is often vulnerable to Mana Void. Mana Break diminishes Storm Spirit's mobility with Ball Lightning, and Anti-Mage can catch him with Blink over short distances.

Aphotic Shield does nothing against Berserkers Call and has to be used constantly to remove the very small mana cost of Battle Hunger in lane.", "[Anti-Mage]: Berserker's Call is one of the most reliable ways to lock down Anti-Mage, preventing him from Blinking away. Anti-Mage's high attack speed, along with illusions from Manta Style, triggers Counter Helix continuously. Axe's low mana pool and high health pool make Mana Void deal very little damage to Axe.", "[Broodmother]: Berserker's Call can catch Broodmother in her web, as well as groups of spiderlings. This is particularly effective when Broodmother attempts to push towers with her spiderlings. Counter Helix destroys spiderlings very quickly and earns Axe a good deal of gold.", "[Dazzle]: Culling Blade ignores the protection from Shallow Grave and will kill any target whose health is low enough. This makes Axe one of the hardest counters to Dazzle, and he neutralizes one of Dazzle's most important abilities.", "[Huskar]: Huskar is often played at low health to maximize the bonuses from Berserker's Blood, and also because his abilities cost health to use. This makes him especially vulnerable to Culling Blade. Berserker's Blood gives Huskar no protection against the pure damage of Culling Blade. Its attack speed bonus also means that Counter Helix will proc more often. Axe's tankiness and base health regeneration makes it hard for Huskar to take him down with Burning Spears.", "[Morphling]: Jumping on Axe with Waveform will make Morphling an easy target for a counter-initiation with Berserker's Call. Morphling is often played at low health to maximize the bonuses from Attribute Shift (Agility Gain), and also because his abilities cost health to use. This makes him especially vulnerable to Culling Blade. However, Morphling is a common Linken's Sphere carrier to block Culling Blade, which may force Axe to use Battle Hunger to pop the Spell Block first. Attribute Shift (Agility Gain) gives Morphling no protection against the pure damage of Culling Blade. Its attack speed bonus also means that Counter Helix will proc more often.", "[Nyx Assassin]: A well-timed Berserker's Call can expose Nyx Assassin while he is invisible with Vendetta, and prevent him from using Spiked Carapace. Axe can use Battle Hunger's damage over time to minimize the effects of Spiked Carapace. Axe's high health also allows him to easily shrug off Nyx Assassin's burst damage and fend him off, especially since Axe is a common Heart of Tarrasque wielder, which can completely eliminate any chance for Nyx Assassin to kill Axe alone. Culling Blade can often kill Nyx Assassin as he is very fragile and vulnerable to damage while Spiked Carapace is on cooldown.", "[Phantom Assassin]: Phantom Strike's extra attack speed will cause Phantom Assassin to trigger Counter Helix more often, which can be fatal for Phantom Assassin. Jumping on Axe with Phantom Strike is not a good idea for Phantom Assassin at all as it makes her a seriously easy target for a counter-initiation with Berserker's Call and Blade Mail. Most of Axe's abilities pierce Black King Bar, allowing him to lock down Phantom Assassin at any time. Berserker's Call greatly reduces Phantom Assassin's ability to crit hard against Axe and may cause her to kill herself when used with Blade Mail. Berserker's Call can also affect Phantom Assassin even if she has Black King Bar active, as it fully pierces spell immunity, making Berserker's Call one of the best abilities in the game against heroes like Phantom Assassin who want to kill opponents quickly without being interrupted. Culling Blade can often kill Phantom Assassin before she can do anything due to her low health and strength gain. Every time Culling Blade successfully kills Phantom Assassin or any of her teammates, Axe gains permanent armor from it. This, in combination with armor items that Axe often purchases like Blade Mail, Crimson Guard, Assault Cuirass, and Shiva's Guard, can make Phantom Assassin's attacks only tickle Axe. Aghanim's Shard upgraded Counter Helix can weaken Phantom Assassin's damage output, and if her attack damage is weak, Coup de Grace will also suffer from attack damage reduction as well.", "[Phantom Lancer]: Berserker's Call catches Phantom Lancer when he is hidden among his illusions. Counter Helix quickly destroys Phantom Lancer's illusion army. The more illusions there are, the more often Counter Helix is triggered. Phantom Lancer's low early game health makes him an easy target for Culling Blade.", "[Slark]: Berserker's Call catches Slark in Shadow Dance, wasting its duration and preventing him from escaping to regenerate. Unlike most disables, Dark Pact cannot dispel Berserker's Call, and the output damage would be returned by Blade Mail.", "[Terrorblade]: Terrorblade's low base health and lack of mobility make him an easy target for Axe to initiate on and kill. Counter Helix will trigger from and destroy many of Terrorblade's illusions.", "[Troll Warlord]: Troll Warlord's high attack speed means Counter Helix will proc extremely frequently even without creeps near him. This, combined with a Blade Mail, means Axe can easily solo kill Troll Warlord even in later stages of the game. Battle Trance does not save Troll Warlord from a Culling Blade.", "[Weaver]: Berserker's Call is one of the best ways to lock down Weaver before he has a chance to use Time Lapse. It can also catch Weaver in Shukuchi. Weaver's high attack speed, along with high attack damage from Geminate Attack, triggers Counter Helix continuously, and the output damage would be returned by Blade Mail.", "[Chaos Knight]: Berserker's Call can make quick work of Phantasm. However, if Axe doesn't manage to destroy the illusions within the duration of the call, Reality Rift will make very quick work of Axe in the mid and late game.", "Melee heroes who rely on summons, illusions, or clones will trigger Counter Helix more often, thus taking more damage: [Meepo], [Lycan], [Phantom Lancer]", "Heroes who rely on fast attack speed will also trigger Counter Helix frequently: [Faceless Void], [Troll Warlord], [Anti-Mage], [Juggernaut], [Arc Warden], [Morphling]", "Abilities that provide attack speed bonus: Alacrity, Bloodrage, [Inner Beast].", "Heroes with low health and high attack damage can easily kill themselves against the Berserker's Call and Blade Mail combo.", "Heroes with gap-closing abilities will be easy targets for Berserker's Call: [Phantom Assassin], [Faceless Void], [Slark], [Chaos Knight], [Morphling], [Queen of Pain]", "Battle Hunger can and should be used to disable a Linken's Sphere due to its low cooldown."

With Firefly combined with Blink Dagger, [Batrider] can move faster while dealing damage to both [Arc Warden] and Tempest Double. Flaming Lasso allows [Batrider] to separate [Arc Warden] from both Magnetic Field and Tempest Double and pull him towards [Batrider]'s team. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Flaming Lasso also allows [Batrider] to disable both the real [Arc Warden] and his Tempest Double and pull them towards [Batrider]'s team. Since [Arc Warden] is not used to buying Linken's Sphere, this can be a great problem for him. Since [Arc Warden] is not used to buying Black King Bar very often in most stages of the game, he will be vulnerable to [Batrider]'s magical damage-over-time output. However, [Batrider] needs to approach [Arc Warden] carefully as [Arc Warden] can scout [Batrider]'s location with Spark Wraith.

Flaming Lasso can pull [Chen] away from his creeps toward [Batrider]'s team, often to certain death.", "[Io]: [Batrider]'s Flaming Lasso can be used to cancel [Io]'s attempts to escape with Relocate and drag him away from his Tethered target. And since [Io] doesn't like buying Linken's Sphere, he will always be vulnerable to [Batrider]'s initiations. [Io]'s tendency to stick close to its Tethered target can make [Io] and its target vulnerable to [Batrider]'s harassing.

However, Enigma can do the same to Broodmother's spiderlings with Demonic Conversion and Midnight Pulse. Without the protection from Black King Bar, Broodmother can cancel Enigma's Black Hole with Bloodthorn and make him more vulnerable to damage. Broodmother can also buy Abyssal Blade to cancel Enigma's Black Hole even through Black King Bar. Silken Bola causes Enigma's attacks to miss a lot and renders him more vulnerable to magical damage. If Broodmother takes the 400 AOE Silken Bola talent, she can cause Enigma's Eidolons to miss their attacks as well. Additionally, Enigma does not typically buy items to provide him true strike, such as Bloodthorn, Monkey King Bar, Witch Blade, and its upgrade Revenant's Brooch. If Broodmother is lucky enough to survive being trapped in Black Hole, she will be able to recover her lost health with Insatiable Hunger. Aghanim's Scepter gives Broodmother access to Spinner's Snare, which allows her to create invisible lines on her webs from Spin Web that will root Enigma, deal damage over time to Enigma, and reveal Enigma if he unwittingly steps on them, disrupting his attempts to initiate with Black Hole, prevent him from using Blink Dagger, and alerting Broodmother on his attempts to ambush her and her allies.","[Medusa]: Webbed areas can be used to hit and run, covering distance hastily, weakening her on the way and initiating ganks. Even though Medusa can hunt down Spiderlings easily when given enough range, Silken Bola will cause her attacks to miss and get her swarmed in no time. Medusa usually does not build a Black King Bar to benefit from Mana Shield fully, while Broodmother can fit a Diffusal Blade to burn away all of Medusa's mana.","[Mirana]: Though Mirana can clear waves of Broodmother's spiderlings with Starstorm, Broodmother will often stick with her spiderlings from Spawn Spiderlings, which in combination with the huge speed provided by Spin Web can make it hard for Mirana to hit her with Sacred Arrow. Broodmother commonly buys Orchid Malevolence and its upgrade Bloodthorn, which allows her to prevent Mirana from escaping with both Leap and Moonlight Shadow and from fighting back with Starstorm.","[Nature's Prophet]: Sprout cannot protect Nature's Prophet if Broodmother puts down a web. Nature's Prophet's low mobility means he is defenseless against Silken Bola. Spiderlings can absorb much of the damage from Wrath of Nature.","[Phantom Assassin]: Phantom Assassin's single-target abilities make her very helpless against swarms of Spiderlings without Battle Fury. Because Phantom Assassin is always reliant on critical strikes, Broodmother will usually have enough time to use Spin Web to save herself. Silken Bola can cripple Phantom Assassin greatly due to her being 100% reliant on physical attacks.","[Sniper]: Sniper is completely helpless against Broodmother's abilities and can be seriously damaged by Spiderlings in lane, especially when Shrapnel is on cooldown.","[Treant Protector]: Spiderlings melt away Living Armor almost instantly. The vision from Eyes In The Forest may prove dangerous for Broodmother, however."});

Centaur Warrunner deals huge AoE damage and applies an AoE disable through Hoof Stomp, affecting the double as well as the main Arc Warden. Magnetic Field is not very effective against melee heroes, and to make things worse, Magnetic Field also increases Arc Warden and his allies' attack speed, meaning Retaliate will deal more damage. Stampede catches Arc Warden easily due to his lack of escape mechanisms, but Arc Warden can counter this problem with Clumsy Net or other items.","[Doom]: Whenever Doom casts his ultimate, Centaur Warrunner can cast Stampede and allow the Doomed hero to run away, wasting Doom's ultimate.","[Nyx Assassin]: Centaur's low Intelligence makes Mind Flare do low damage. With some creative skill builds, Centaur's Hoof Stomp stun duration should always last longer than Nyx's Spiked Carapace stun, making it hard for Nyx to escape unscathed. With Blink Dagger and detection, Centaur can easily catch and devastate Nyx in the open. However, Nyx can also initiate on Centaur Warrunner if he anticipates with Spiked Carapace and Vendetta, reflecting Retaliate damage and stunning Centaur.","[Pangolier]: Pangolier will proc Retaliate several times if he attempts to use Swashbuckle on Centaur Warrunner. Centaur can cast Stampede to allow his allies to easily avoid Rolling Thunder. Centaur's tankiness makes it hard for Pangolier to burst him down in the late game.","[Phantom Assassin]: Hoof Stomp and Double Edge can often burst down Phantom Assassin from early to mid-game. Retaliate makes it very unlikely for Phantom Assassin to win the lane against Warrunner. Double Edge can also be used to wear her down, as she has a much smaller health pool than that of Centaur Warrunner until purchasing a Ring of Health. Dagger will also trigger Retaliate, and Blur cannot evade Retaliate. Centaur Warrunner's tankiness in combination with armor items can make Phantom Assassin's attacks ineffective. Centaur Warrunner just has to be aware of Fan of Knives from Aghanim's Shard and Coup de Grace, as Fan of Knives can disable Retaliate even if Centaur Warrunner is spell immune.","[Phantom Lancer]: His illusions will kill themselves in a few hits because of Retaliate. The nukes from Hoof Stomp and Double-Edge should be enough to clear them for a large portion of the game. Centaur Warrunner's small mana pool makes Diffusal Blade's damage much lower once Centaur doesn't have any more mana left to burn. Be wary when chasing down Phantom Lancer, as Stomp's cast time makes it easy to dodge with Doppelganger.","[Sniper]: Headshot and Shrapnel slows are ineffective against a team with haste (which Stampede gives). Commonly picked up mobility items and hasted movement during Stampede, as well as his high health pool, make him extremely hard to kill from a distance. He can damage Sniper with Retaliate and Blade Mail if Sniper has a low health pool and no escape mechanism, making him an easy target for Centaur Warrunner's burst damage and initiation.","[Windranger]: Focus Fire grants Windranger a massive attack speed bonus, while her attack damage is generally quite low. This, combined with Windranger's low health pool, makes Retaliate do absolutely massive damage over a short time, making Centaur a hero she can never expect to kill or harass. Windrun grants evasion, but Centaur Warrunner relies on successful attacks to do damage. Hoof Stomp, Double Edge, and all do large amounts of magical damage and can completely demolish Windranger in a moment.","[Troll Warlord]: Troll Warlord's high-speed attack makes Retaliate deal a lot of damage to him.","[Night Stalker]: Night Stalker relies on right-click attacks, and his nuke, Void, is not as threatening once you have a Hood of Defiance as your core item.","[Anti-Mage]: Anti-Mage's Mana Void won't do a lot of damage because Centaur has a low mana pool. Mana Break is also relatively ineffective against him.",});

Bounty Hunter is fragile and can easily be killed by Chaos Knight and Phantasm's illusions.","[Disruptor]: Phantasm removes Glimpse and dispels Thunder Strike. Additionally, Phantasm illusions make it difficult to use Glimpse and Thunder Strike on the real Chaos Knight. Disruptor's lack of mobility, combined with his lack of innate defense, sets him up for a Reality Rift and a beatdown by Chaos Knight and his illusions.","[Huskar]: Huskar's low armor and movement speed make him an easy target for Chaos Knight to initiate on with Reality Rift and Chaos Bolt. Besides Inner Fire, Huskar has no reliable area of effect ability to clear Phantasm illusions. Huskar likes to fight at low health to benefit from his Berserker's Blood, thus making him vulnerable to Chaos Knight's high burst physical damage.","[Lifestealer]: The level 20 talent allows Reality Rift to bypass spell immunity provided by Rage, negating the advantage Lifestealer has in his kit. The fact that Lifestealer lacks wave clearing and reliable lockdown makes it difficult to fight Chaos Knight illusions. Feast is largely negated by Chaos Knight's high burst damage from Chaos Strike.","[Lone Druid]: Reality Rift lets Chaos Knight bypass Spirit Bear and get to Lone Druid. The Spirit Bear's lack of scaling means it dies quickly to Chaos Knight during the late game. Phantasm's illusions make it difficult to land Meat Hook and Dismember. Chaos Bolt is a low cooldown tool to interrupt Dismember. Chaos Strike's lifesteal offsets Rot's damage.","[Slark]: Dark Pact is minimally effective against Phantasm illusions, and Slark lacks area damage otherwise. Pounce can be countered by Reality Rift. Slark is naturally frail and dies quickly to Chaos Knight's burst damage before he can build Essence Shift stacks. However, be aware that Shadow Dance can make Slark hard to kill as he can't be targeted during its duration.", "[Sniper]: Sniper is very fragile, and his low movement speed makes him an exceptionally easy target for Chaos Knight to initiate on. Sniper has no innate ability to deal with Phantasm or escape a Reality Rift and Chaos Bolt combo. In most cases, Sniper likes to stay in the far backline to deal damage, thus he is vulnerable if Chaos Knight manages to jump in the backline, which will usually spell a quick end for Sniper.","[Ursa]: Ursa cannot effectively fight against Phantasm's illusions with his damage. Chaos Bolt's potentially long stun duration gives Ursa little opportunity to Enrage.","[Viper]: As Viper focuses on single-target damage, he has trouble fighting off Phantasm illusions.

Power Cogs push Legion Commander away from Clockwerk's allies when she enters a Duel.","[Monkey King]: Power Cogs push Monkey King out of Wukong's Command, ending his ultimate. Rocket Flare allows Clockwerk to scout Monkey King in the trees and chase him with Hookshot.","[Pudge]: Meat Hooking a Clockwerk can backfire for Pudge, as Battery Assault and Blade Mail will hurt Pudge more than he hurts Clockwerk.","[Pugna]: Pugna's squishiness and lack of mobility make him easy prey for a Hookshot initiation. Clockwerk's high health, low mana costs, and lack of reliance on Blink Dagger make Nether Ward ineffective. Battery Assault shuts down Aghanim's Scepter-upgraded Life Drain, as the repeated mini-stuns prevent Pugna from channeling for an extended length of time.","[Sniper]: Clockwerk is also the least optimal target for Sniper to attack in a teamfight, although more experienced players will rarely make this mistake.

Spirit Breaker's slow 0.6-second attack animation does little damage against Clockwerk and can constantly be interrupted by Battery Assault. Nether Strike's 1.2-second charge time gives Clockwerk plenty of time to activate Blade Mail and for Battery Assault to cancel it.","[Tinker]: Rocket Flare can find Tinker if he blinks into the treeline, and Hookshot will prevent him from teleporting out.

Slark has no innate way to cancel Freezing Field, but the common purchase of Skull Basher does make Slark a greater threat to Crystal Maiden as the game progresses. Freezing Field can still hit Slark while he is under the effect of Shadow Dance, and for the early and mid-game, the damage output of Crystal Maiden's ultimate outscales Slark's passive regeneration. Crystal Maiden's Frostbite and Crystal Nova are helpful in disabling and slowing Slark so he can be killed by her teammates.","[Phantom Assassin]: Crystal Maiden's skillset, consisting of magical damage nukes, poses a substantial threat to Phantom Assassin through the mid-game, especially if followed up with engagement by her team. A quick use of Freezing Field directly after Phantom Strike can leave Phantom Assassin trapped inside the area of effect, capitalizing on her relatively low HP pool when she is not protected by Blur. If Phantom Assassin chooses not to buy a Black King Bar relatively early, the attack slow from Freezing Field can hinder the proc chance of Coup de Grace in a teamfight.","[Templar Assassin]: Crystal Maiden's combination of spells, when executed properly and stacked with her team, can spell the end for Templar Assassin. Frostbite can quickly eat away at Refraction charges, leaving Templar Assassin vulnerable for the rest of her team to kill. Freezing Field still applies damage to Templar Assassin when she is under the effect of Meld, making it an even less viable form of escape until a Blink Dagger is purchased. Blink Dagger is also canceled by all of Crystal Maiden's spells, and the fairly short cooldowns on Frostbite and Crystal Nova make her a great asset to a chase against Templar Assassin.","[Terrorblade]: While Terrorblade can kill Crystal Maiden due to her low durability with Reflection and Metamorphosis, Crystal Maiden can do the same to him if he is not careful. Crystal Nova and Freezing Field can destroy Terrorblade's illusions from Conjure Image and Manta Style, while they can also kill Terrorblade from early to mid-game if he has no Black King Bar. Terrorblade has no disable in his ability set and no solutions to cancel Crystal Maiden's Freezing Field. Additionally, he typically doesn't like purchasing disabling items like Scythe of Vyse or Abyssal Blade, which are the only solutions to deal with Crystal Maiden's Freezing Field outside of Black King Bar.

Spirit Siphon both damages and slows Chen, while healing Death Prophet.","[Invoker]: Quas-Exort Invoker is vulnerable to Death Prophet due to his lack of Wex for increased movement speed while stealthed. The Forge Spirit and Cold Snap combo is less effective against Death Prophet since she can drain Invoker's HP with Spirit Siphon, forcing him to retreat. Silence prevents Invoker from using Invoke or casting his main spells temporarily, and there's no way for Invoker to dispel it unless he has Eul's Scepter of Divinity or assistance from allies.","[Morphling]: Death Prophet can disrupt Morphling with Silence. A Morphling affected by Silence cannot use Attribute Shift (Strength Gain) to increase his health pool or use Waveform to escape.","[Timbersaw]: Silence can easily disable Timbersaw in a teamfight since he relies heavily on his spells for damage. Exorcism's spirits do not count as regular attacks, so they will not add stacks to Timbersaw's Reactive Armor.","[Nature's Prophet]: Crypt Swarm clears waves of Treants, while Silence prevents Nature's Prophet from using Sprout or Teleportation. Exorcism kills Treants with ease."});

However, Anti-Mage's Counterspell can negate a significant portion of Disruptor's damage, often requiring assistance from a teammate to successfully eliminate Anti-Mage.",

        "[Io]: Disruptor can use Glimpse to bring back Io or his target after they've Relocated nearby. The indicator on the ground allows for preemptive placement of Static Storm and Kinetic Field where Io is likely to relocate to. Thunder Strike and Glimpse are useful tools to bring back an Io that has Tethered away into the fog of war.","[Queen of Pain]: Glimpse can disrupt Queen of Pain's Blink, countering her mobility. Static Storm is devastating for Queen of Pain since she relies heavily on her spells for burst damage. Thunder Strike provides vision on Slark while he is invisible. Glimpse's range at level 3-4 is sufficient to pull Slark back to a favorable position for the team to engage and eliminate him. Disruptor's AoE silence and the ability to mute Black King Bar are powerful against Slark at all stages of the game.","[Storm Spirit]: Around the 10-minute mark, Disruptor typically reaches level 6 or 7, granting a level 3-4 Glimpse along with Static Storm. This level of Glimpse is usually sufficient to pull Storm Spirit back to a Static Storm, especially given his mana pool at that time. However, in the late game, Storm Spirit may have enough damage to eliminate Disruptor before Glimpse finishes, potentially bringing him back to safety unless silenced.","[Tidehunter]: In the mid-game, Tidehunter relies on Kraken Shell to survive and cast Ravage. Apart from Thunder Strike, none of Disruptor's abilities can be dispelled, making it relatively easy to trap Tidehunter inside Kinetic Field and Static Storm. Be cautious, though, as Kraken Shell still makes Tidehunter quite tanky, so ensure you have the damage to kill him while he is silenced and trapped, either through your combo or with the help of teammates."});

Doom has low attack speed due to his high Base-Attack-Time, poor agility gain, and limited attack-speed granting items, which means he triggers Counter Helix less often, making him an less-than-ideal target for initiation. Doom's naturally high HP also prolongs the time it takes for him to reach the killing threshold of Culling Blade. Additionally, Axe is heavily reliant on his abilities and items for effectiveness in fights, and Doom can disable him, rendering him ineffective.","[Timbersaw]: Infernal Blade's scaling damage is effective against high HP targets like Timbersaw. Timbersaw heavily relies on his abilities for mobility, damage, and crowd control, offering very little impactful right-click damage. Doom's Aghanim's Scepter also breaks Reactive Armor, reducing Timbersaw's durability.","[Anti-Mage]: Doom prevents Anti-Mage from maneuvering around fights or escaping with Blink. Doom deals pure damage, unaffected by Counterspell, which can quickly wear down Anti-Mage's naturally low health pool. However, a well-timed Counterspell can block and reflect Doom back against Doom himself. Aghanim's Scepter-upgraded Doom will disable Mana Break and Counterspell, making Anti-Mage less effective in fights and more susceptible to Doom's high magical damage and his allies.","[Bristleback]: Infernal Blade's scaling damage is effective against high HP targets like Bristleback. Doom prevents Bristleback from casting his low cooldown abilities, disrupting his Warpath stacks. With Aghanim's Scepter, Doom can also disable Bristleback and Warpath, significantly reducing his durability and damage potential in team fights.","[Tidehunter]: Infernal Blade's scaling damage is useful against high HP targets like Tidehunter. Doom prevents Tidehunter from using his abilities, including Gush, Anchor Smash, and Ravage, rendering him useless in team fights. Aghanim's Scepter-upgraded Doom can also disable Kraken Shell, reducing Tidehunter's survivability.","[Ember Spirit]: Doom prevents Ember Spirit from using Activate Fire Remnant to escape while under its effect.","[Invoker]: Doom completely removes Invoker from a team fight. Invoker heavily relies on abilities and items to contribute in team fights, making him a prime target for Doom.", "[Mirana]: Doom can shut down all of Mirana's abilities, and she cannot escape with Leap while under the effect of Doom. Doom can also catch Mirana if she attempts to use combo items like Aghanim's Scepter and Blink Dagger or Overwhelming Blink to move quickly, rendering her abilities like Leap and Moonlight Shadow useless.","[Omniknight]: Doom applies a basic dispel upon cast, allowing it to remove Guardian Angel. Casting Doom on Omniknight also prevents him from healing allies with Purification or casting buffs like Heavenly Grace and Guardian Angel.","[Tinker]: Tinker is heavily reliant on active abilities, and Doom prevents him from using any of them.","[Elder Titan]: Infernal Blade deals scaling damage useful against high HP targets like Elder Titan and can interrupt Echo Stomp if used quickly. Doom's low base armor and high HP make him less affected by Natural Order.","[Faceless Void]: Faceless Void relies on Time Walk for mobility and survivability, but Doom prevents him from using it. His abilities have cooldown durations, except for Infernal Blade, so he isn't significantly affected by Time Dilation.","[Pudge]: Infernal Blade's damage is calculated as a percentage of max health, making it particularly effective against Pudge due to his high strength growth with Flesh Heap. Timing Doom against Pudge while he has Rot activated can often result in his death.","[Spectre]: Infernal Blade's damage is calculated based on a percentage of max health, which can hurt Spectre more than normal attacks due to her typical tankiness. Doom can entirely disable Spectre from a teamfight, and if upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter, it will disable her passive skills that she relies on.","[Windranger]: Doom can disable all of Windranger's active abilities, and she cannot escape with Windrun or Focus Fire while under the effect of Doom.","[Arc Warden]: Arc Warden relies on items, abilities, and his Tempest Double to deal damage to enemies. Doom effectively nullifies these capabilities, rendering Arc Warden useless in fights."});

The extra damage from Searing Arrows is mostly blocked by Dragon Knight's armor, and Breathe Fire reduces Bloodseeker's damage further.","[Clinkz]: Clinkz's low health pool makes him vulnerable to ganks. Dragon Knight's stuns can keep Clinkz down long enough for a reaction, and Breathe Fire reduces Clinkz's damage, as it deals physical damage.","[Nyx Assassin]: Dragon Knight's heavy armor negates Vendetta's burst physical damage, and his large HP pool gives him a good chance of surviving Nyx Assassin's follow-up nuke damage.","[Riki]: Riki's low physical damage, modest attack speed, and lack of burst damage make him ineffective against Dragon Knight.","[Spirit Breaker]: Spirit Breaker's slow attack speed and moderate damage do little harm to Dragon Knight, even if ganked with Charge of Darkness.","[Templar Assassin]: Despite the armor reduction from Meld, Templar Assassin's reliance on physical damage and medium attack speed is unlikely to harm Dragon Knight. Dragon Knight's damage over time from his ultimate quickly removes Templar Assassin's Refraction charges.","[Phantom Lancer]: Dragon Knight's splash damage wears down Phantom Lancer's illusions.

Gust prevents him from blinking in or out, Counterspell is not effective against Drow's physical damage, and as she usually doesn't have a high mana pool, Mana Break and Mana Void don't do much either. However, be cautious as Anti-Mage can eventually farm enough to Blink on top of Drow Ranger and kill her.","[Clinkz]: Clinkz lacks a stun and prefers to keep his distance, making him vulnerable to Drow Ranger's deadly Marksmanship. Clinkz also has low health, making him an ideal target for initiation with Gust. Gust can also prevent Clinkz from using Burning Barrage.","[Enigma]: While Black Hole is a threat to Drow Ranger, it is challenging to land because she tends to keep her distance. If not caught in Black Hole, Drow Ranger can quickly eliminate Enigma due to his low health. Malefice can be removed with a Manta Style, and Drow Ranger's high armor and agility reduce the damage from Midnight Pulse. Demonic Conversion units die quickly to Marksmanship.","[Morphling]: Attribute Shift (Strength Gain) may not be quick enough to fend off an attacking Drow Ranger. Morphling's tendency to have low health and high agility makes him vulnerable to Drow Ranger's Marksmanship procs. None of Drow Ranger's spells are particularly effective against Morphling.","[Terrorblade]: Metamorphosis will not match Drow Ranger's range, making it challenging for Terrorblade to deal damage to her if she is not already locked down. Conjure Image units are quickly destroyed by Marksmanship. Drow Ranger often targets Terrorblade in teamfights because he typically sits in the frontlines, and his high base armor and agility items make him vulnerable to Marksmanship.","[Weaver]: A well-timed Gust can prevent Weaver from escaping, and a silenced Weaver is usually eliminated quickly. Marksmanship bypasses the armor that Weaver gains from his agility items.","[Rubick]: A well-timed Gust can prevent Rubick from casting abilities stolen with Spell Steal.

Earth Spirit can jump on him with Rolling Boulder, disable him, and buy time for his teammates to assist. The long range of Stone Remnant and Rolling Boulder can also prevent Tinker from teleporting to his fountain, which he often relies on for escapes.","[Invoker]: Earth Spirit can be a formidable opponent for Invoker in the early game. Invoker needs to gain levels quickly and is relatively weak early on, making him vulnerable to Earth Spirit's ganks. Earth Spirit's long-range stuns and silences can disrupt Invoker's combos and disrupt his game plan.","[Templar Assassin]: Templar Assassin relies on Refraction in teamfights, and Earth Spirit's Magnetize can waste her Refraction charges, allowing his team to take her down.","[Enigma]: Earth Spirit can interrupt channeling spells like Black Hole in at least two ways, making it difficult for Enigma to land the spell. Earth Spirit's long-range Rolling Boulder can reach Enigma and force him to rush a Black King Bar to prevent interruptions.

Stuns, silences, or burst damage can take advantage of his low strength when he's morphed into high agility. Earth Splitter can burst him down, and Natural Order combined with Blade Mail can make him hurt himself with auto-attacks or his magical damage combo.","[Phantom Lancer]: Phantom Lancer's lack of disables makes it hard for him to interrupt Echo Stomp's channeling. However, he can use Manta Style and/or Doppelganger to dodge abilities due to their long cast times. His high agility and low strength make him vulnerable to Natural Order. Echo Stomp and Earth Splitter can clear his illusions, and if he goes for Heart of Tarrasque, Earth Splitter does more damage to him and his illusions.","[Slark]: Natural Order aura prevents Slark from gaining armor through Essence Shift's agility steal. Echo Stomp and Earth Splitter can hit Slark through his Shadow Dance ultimate. Slark's low stats, compared to most agility carries, make him relatively squishy without his agility-based armor.","[Terrorblade]: Terrorblade has high base armor and relies on ultimate orb-based items like Manta Style and Eye of Skadi, which are affected by Natural Order. Terrorblade's low health combined with Natural Order's armor reduction can make him vulnerable. His illusions often group up in teamfights, making them more susceptible to Echo Stomp.","[Viper]: Viper is an agility hero who usually builds agility items. Natural Order can be devastating, removing all armor and greatly reducing the effectiveness of Corrosive Skin's magic resistance.

Additionally, Huskar's low mana pool means he takes less damage once it's depleted, making Mana Void ineffective. Huskar tends to come online earlier than Anti-Mage, potentially taking control of the game before Anti-Mage can farm up.","[Zeus]: Huskar's Burning Spears can chip away at Zeus's low health pool rapidly, forcing him to invest in health regen or abandon the lane. Zeus, relying on magic damage, has limited options against Huskar and is susceptible to being killed if Huskar lands Life Break due to Zeus's poor mobility.","[Weaver]: Weaver cannot Time Lapse out of the burst damage inflicted by Huskar.","[Clockwerk]: Clockwerk's abilities are inadequate for dealing with Huskar in a one-on-one fight, even if he initiates the engagement.","[Dragon Knight]: Huskar can negate Dragon Knight's passive with repeated applications of Burning Spear.","[Earthshaker]: Earthshaker's stuns are unlikely to save him once Huskar initiates with Life Break. A full initiation combo won't kill Huskar, but it can lower his health and increase his attack speed.","[Ember Spirit]: Ember Spirit's damage against Huskar is minimal until the very late game.","[Nature's Prophet]: Nature's Prophet's Sprout won't protect him from Huskar if Huskar has already targeted him with Life Break.

However, Huskar can dispel Cold Snap with Life Break. Sun Strike's pure damage, which pierces spell immunity, can be effective against Huskar.","[Legion Commander]: Invoker's spells can disable and damage Legion Commander while she's in a Duel.","[Medusa]: Invoker can use E.M.P. to burn Medusa's mana, weakening her Mana Shield. Medusa's lack of mobility makes her susceptible to kiting with Invoker's spells.","[Necrophos]: Invoker's Tornado can purge Necrophos's Ghost Shroud, nullifying its benefits. E.M.P. can also burn Necrophos's mana, preventing him from using his abilities frequently.","[Tinker]: Invoker can easily interrupt Tinker's Rearm and Boots of Travel with long-range disables, even if Tinker blinks away.","[Wraith King]: E.M.P. can burn Wraith King's mana to prevent Reincarnation from triggering (until he gets his Aghanim's Shard). Ice Wall and Cold Snap are effective at kiting Wraith King and preventing melee attack damage.","[Spirit Breaker]: Invoker's Ice Wall can slow down Charge of Darkness at max level, allowing for counterplays like using Cold Snap to end the charge, bursting Spirit Breaker down with Tornado, Meteor, and right clicks, or even teleporting back to spawn to drag Spirit Breaker into the fountain.

Io's Tether on a friendly unit can also destroy Nature's Prophet's trees if he surrounds himself with Sprout as a defense.","[Phoenix]: Io can use Relocate to save allies from Phoenix's limited AOE, damage-over-time abilities.","[Pudge]: Io's Tether and Overcharge can make it harder for Pudge to secure kills with Meat Hook, and Relocate can save Io's ally while Dismember is being channeled.","[Underlord]: Io can escape from Pit of Malice using Tether or Relocate.

Dual Breath and Macropyre can disrupt Chen's jungling.","[Chaos Knight]: Jakiro can easily kill Chaos Knight's Phantasm illusions with his AoE damage. Chaos Knight's tendency to not buy Black King Bar makes him vulnerable to Jakiro's Ice Path into Macropyre combo.","[Crystal Maiden]: Ice Path can cancel Crystal Maiden's Freezing Field easily. Freezing Field makes her susceptible to all of Jakiro's abilities without a Black King Bar. Jakiro's Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre pierces spell immunity, discouraging Crystal Maiden from using Freezing Field.","[Dark Willow]: Jakiro's AoE abilities can hit Dark Willow even when she is in Shadow Realm. Timing Ice Path can stun her during her maximum damage phase. Jakiro can also stun Dark Willow when there is about 1 second left on Cursed Crown, as Ice Path's stun duration is slightly longer.","[Enigma]: Jakiro's damage-over-time abilities can put Enigma's Blink Dagger on cooldown, potentially forcing him to use Black King Bar prematurely. Jakiro can easily cancel Black Hole with Ice Path, making Enigma an easy target while channeling. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre pierces spell immunity, discouraging Enigma from initiating with Black Hole.","[Io]: Jakiro's area-of-effect abilities can make it difficult for Io to save multiple heroes at once. Ice Path can cancel both Tether and Relocate. Jakiro's common purchase of Rod of Atos can be used to cancel Relocate, prevent Io from escaping with Tether, and make him an easy target for Ice Path and Macropyre.","[Lion]: Ice Path can easily cancel Mana Drain, but Lion can counter this with Aghanim's Shard. Jakiro can also counter Lion with Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre, dealing pure damage through debuff immunity. Jakiro's shorter cast ranges allow him to cast abilities before Lion can Hex or Earth Spike. Jakiro can also save an ally from Lion's Finger of Death by casting Ice Path on Lion.","[Luna]: Jakiro can efficiently harass Luna with Dual Breath and Liquid Fire. He can also save allies from Luna during Eclipse attempts by casting Ice Path on Luna. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre deals pure damage over time and pierces spell immunity, making it difficult for Luna to engage in teamfights without taking significant damage.","[Meepo]: Jakiro's AoE skills can easily affect all Meepos in a targeted area.","[Naga Siren]: Jakiro's damage-over-time abilities can clear Naga Siren's illusions and damage the real Naga Siren, even during Song of the Siren. Naga Siren's reluctance to purchase Black King Bar makes her vulnerable to Jakiro's damage over time throughout the game.", "[Nature's Prophet]: Jakiro's skillset can disrupt Nature's Prophet's gameplay. Dual Breath and Liquid Fire clear treants from Nature's Call, slow Nature's Prophet, and Ice Path can interrupt his Teleportation. Macropyre is also effective at clearing treants.","[Phantom Lancer]: Jakiro's AoE spells can quickly deal with Phantom Lancer's illusions. However, Jakiro needs to be cautious once Phantom Lancer gets Diffusal Blade, as it can burn his mana and make him vulnerable to counter-attacks.","[Puck]: Jakiro's three damage-over-time spells, including Dual Breath and Liquid Fire debuffs, make it easy for him to disable Puck's Blink Dagger. Ice Path is also strong against Puck, stunning him when Phase Shift ends.","[Pugna]: Jakiro's Ice Path and Liquid Frost can cancel Life Drain from Pugna or his allies. Decrepify makes Pugna more vulnerable to Jakiro's magical damage. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre deals pure damage over time and pierces debuff immunity, discouraging Pugna from using Life Drain.","[Riki]: Jakiro can catch Riki easily in an Ice Path and Macropyre combo, but must be cautious of Riki's Smoke Screen.","[Shadow Fiend]: Despite Jakiro's fragility, he can harass Shadow Fiend effectively with Dual Breath and Liquid Fire. Jakiro can cancel Requiem of Souls with Ice Path, making Shadow Fiend an easy target while channeling. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre deals pure damage over time and pierces spell immunity, discouraging Shadow Fiend from initiating with Requiem of Souls.","[Silencer]: Jakiro can be a threat to Silencer, especially if played as a core hero. Silencer is squishy and lacks escape mechanisms, making him vulnerable to Jakiro's damage-over-time abilities. Ice Path can be used to prevent Silencer from escaping, and a combination of Ice Path, Macropyre, and Dual Breath can quickly eliminate Silencer. Jakiro can also reduce Silencer's attack speed with Dual Breath, Liquid Fire, and Liquid Frost from Aghanim's Shard. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre deals significant pure damage, even if Silencer is spell immune.","[Templar Assassin]: Jakiro's area-targeted skills can force Templar Assassin to move out of Meld, and his damage-over-time spells are effective at stripping away Refraction charges.","[Terrorblade]: Jakiro's wide AoE abilities can clear Terrorblade's illusions and damage the real Terrorblade. Both Liquid Fire and Liquid Frost from Aghanim's Shard deal magical damage, bypassing Terrorblade's high armor. Jakiro's range advantage with Hurricane Pike and +275 Attack Range talent allows him to harass Terrorblade safely. Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Macropyre deals substantial pure damage, piercing spell immunity when upgraded. However, Jakiro should be cautious of Terrorblade's Sunder, which can turn the tide if Terrorblade gets close unless Jakiro builds Black King Bar or Linken's Sphere for added protection.","[Tinker]: Tinker's Laser has minimal effect on Jakiro. Jakiro can catch Tinker with Ice Path while he Rearms, potentially leading to his demise. With strong area-of-effect damage-over-time capabilities, Jakiro can quickly burn through Tinker's Defense Matrix and disable his Blink Dagger, which Tinker relies on heavily.","[Tiny]: Jakiro's Dual Breath and Liquid Fire reduce Tiny's already slow attack speed. If Tiny tosses a hero onto Jakiro, he can respond with Ice Path and potentially Macropyre. Ice Path effectively counters Tiny's Avalanche.","[Treant Protector]: Jakiro's Dual Breath, Liquid Fire, and Macropyre can quickly remove Living Armor from a target. Ice Path prevents Treant Protector from using Overgrowth while keeping Jakiro at a safe distance.","[Weaver]: Weaver, with low health and reliance on Shukuchi and Time Lapse, struggles to initiate on Jakiro due to Jakiro's arsenal of stuns. Ice Path can catch Weaver during Shukuchi, and Jakiro can punish Weaver when he uses Time Lapse.","[Witch Doctor]: Jakiro can easily cancel Death Ward or turn it against Witch Doctor with Macropyre. Voodoo Switcheroo is also susceptible to Jakiro's Macropyre/Ice Path combo. While Maledict and Paralyzing Cask can be effective, landing a strong Maledict on Jakiro is difficult. Voodoo Restoration can partially protect Witch Doctor's allies, but it becomes more effective with the Max Health talent at level 25."});

Omnislash can devastate her due to her fragility. However, Shadow Realm can negate attack damage during Omnislash, but it can still jump to other targets.","[Enchantress]: Blade Fury dispels the slow from Enchant and spell immunity to burst her down during the early laning stage. Omnislash and Swiftslash's physical damage ignore Untouchable. Silver Edge is an effective item to deal with Untouchable, making her vulnerable to melee attacks.","[Invoker]: Juggernaut's Blade Fury grants instant spell immunity, helping him avoid Invoker's combos, including dispelling disables from Cold Snap and Deafening Blast. He can also deal with Forge Spirits easily and withstand their attacks due to his high DPS and armor. However, Sun Strike can hit Juggernaut through Blade Fury, making the Tornado and Sun Strike combo a threat if he doesn't dodge Tornado.","[Keeper of the Light]: Juggernaut's Healing Ward keeps his team healthy when pushing against Illuminate. Blade Fury can dispel Blinding Light and dodge Illuminate. If Keeper of the Light obtains Will-O-Wisp through Aghanim's Scepter, Juggernaut can quickly eliminate Ignis Fatuus without being interrupted. Keeper of the Light's low health, armor, and lack of natural defense against Blade Fury make him vulnerable.","[Necrophos]: Blade Fury blocks damage from Death Pulse and Reaper's Scythe. Ghost Shroud decreases Necrophos's magic resistance, making him more susceptible to Blade Fury.","[Nyx Assassin]: Juggernaut's Blade Fury grants immunity to all of Nyx's abilities, except Vendetta. Omnislash and Swiftslash can burst down Nyx, ignoring Spiked Carapace. However, Vendetta can be used to escape and cancel Omnislash or Swiftslash.","[Phoenix]: Juggernaut's high attack speed allows him to easily destroy a Supernova, even during Blade Fury. Blade Fury protects Juggernaut from all of Phoenix's spells except Supernova. It can also dispel the attack speed slow from Fire Spirits and the movement speed slow from Icarus Dive. Phoenix's low armor makes it an easy target.","[Templar Assassin]: Blade Fury's damage over time dispels Templar Assassin's Refraction quickly. Juggernaut's high armor lets him survive long enough to remove Refraction and threaten her with Omnislash. Templar Assassin's short attack range makes it difficult to target a well-placed Healing Ward, and she cannot splash onto it with Psi Blades.","[Zeus]: None of Zeus's abilities can damage a Juggernaut in Blade Fury. His short attack range makes it challenging to target a Healing Ward, and his frequent use of Arc Lightning has minimal effect on allies being healed by Juggernaut. Zeus lacks a reliable self-defense mechanism and can be easily taken out when cornered, even without Omnislash."});

Duel serves as a reliable way to lock down Broodmother, preventing her from retreating into the treeline.","[Chen]: Chen's fragility and limited mobility make him an appealing target for Duel. Legion Commander can make use of Overwhelming Odds and Moment of Courage to capitalize on the numbers of converted creeps.

Duel can lock down Clinkz, preventing him from escaping with Skeleton Walk.","[Drow Ranger]: Drow Ranger's low mobility and absence of defensive abilities make her an easy target for ganks in the early to mid-game.

        "[Dawnbreaker]: Savage Roar can interrupt Starbreaker. Dawnbreaker's slow movement speed can be exploited by Lone Druid's better mobility, allowing him to wear her down over time.",
        
        "[Doom]: Doom is hesitant to use the ability on the Spirit Bear, and using it on Lone Druid won't stop the bear from attacking if True Form has already been activated. Devour doesn't work on the Spirit Bear and pushes the lane, allowing Lone Druid to farm safely under the tower.",
        
        "[Arc Warden]: Lone Druid can overpower Arc Warden in the early to mid-game, countering most of his abilities. The Spirit Bear nullifies Flux, and Spark Wraiths can be soaked by the bear. Lone Druid can go inside Magnetic Fields and punish Arc Warden.",
        
        "[Nature's Prophet]: Lone Druid's Entangle prevents Nature's Prophet from escaping with Teleportation.",

        "[Storm Spirit]: True Form gives Lone Druid a huge health pool that is hard for Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning to chip through. Entangling Claws can quickly end Storm Spirit, preventing him from using Ball Lightning. Lone Druid can use his Shard to fear Storm Spirit away from himself or the bear, protecting the target Storm Spirit doesn't go on."});

Luna's Lucent Beam and Eclipse can disrupt Bane's channeling spells, and her Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Eclipse with mini-stuns can repeatedly stun and deter Bane from using Fiend's Grip. Luna can also buy Abyssal Blade to cancel Fiend's Grip, forcing Bane to consider Linken's Sphere.",

        "[Enigma]: Luna can cancel Enigma's Black Hole from a safe distance with Lucent Beam or use Eclipse to counter-initiate. Satanic can help Luna recover from Black Hole damage, and Moon Glaives can clear Enigma's Eidolons. Luna's options are limited once Enigma obtains Black King Bar.",

Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Eclipse can counter-initiate against Magnus after he uses Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Enchant Totem. Items like Gleipnir and Silver Edge can hinder Magnus's Blink Dagger usage, and Dust of Appearance can reveal him during Silver Edge invisibility.",

        "[Muerta]: Luna can harass Muerta in lane with Lucent Beam. Her high movement speed makes it difficult for Muerta to trap her in The Calling. Lucent Beam can deal significant damage to Muerta, and Luna can consider Abyssal Blade to cancel Muerta's Dead Shot through Black King Bar.",
        
        "[Necrophos]: Luna may struggle in lane against Necrophos, but her Lucent Beam and Eclipse can quickly finish him off, as Ghost Shroud increases the damage he takes from magic sources. Luna's Black King Bar can protect her from Necrophos's spells.",
        
        "[Nyx Assassin]: Luna's Lucent Beam can deal considerable damage to Nyx Assassin if he doesn't have Spiked Carapace available. Luna commonly buys Black King Bar, allowing her to attack Nyx Assassin freely. Dust of Appearance can reveal Nyx Assassin during Vendetta.",
        
        "[Phantom Assassin]: Luna can counter Phantom Assassin if she times her Eclipse right after Phantom Assassin uses Blink Strike, potentially killing her before she can react. Moon Glaives can hit an enemy near Phantom Assassin, bypassing Blur's evasion. Luna can also buy items like Silver Edge or Monkey King Bar to deal with Phantom Assassin's abilities.",
        
        "[Pugna]: Luna's constant damage from Lucent Beam and right-click attacks can be effective against Pugna. Lucent Beam can interrupt Pugna's Life Drain, and Decrepify can be risky for Pugna as it makes him susceptible to Luna's Eclipse. Luna often builds Black King Bar, which protects her from Pugna's magical damage.",
        
        "[Queen of Pain]: Aggressive blinking can backfire against Luna, as Luna can use Lucent Beam and Eclipse to counter-attack. Luna's Eclipse can burst down Queen of Pain quickly after she initiates with Blink.",
        
        "[Riki]: Luna's fast push with Moon Glaives can make it challenging for Riki to deal with split-pushes. Luna's high movement speed makes it hard for Riki to trap her in Smoke Cloud. Dust of Appearance can reveal Riki during invisibility, and Luna can potentially kill him.",
        
        "[Shadow Fiend]: Lucent Beam and Eclipse with mini-stun talent can cancel Requiem of Souls if Shadow Fiend lacks Black King Bar. Moon Glaives and Lunar Blessing can help Luna outfarm Shadow Fiend and deal physical damage. Luna's Eclipse can burst down Shadow Fiend quickly, especially when equipped with Aghanim's Scepter and Ethereal Blade.",

Aghanim's Scepter upgraded Eclipse with mini-stuns can repeatedly stun and discourage Shadow Shaman from using Shackles. Luna often buys Black King Bar, which helps her defend against Shadow Shaman's abilities.",

If Rubick steals Mass Serpent Ward, it becomes a potent tool for teamfights, pushing, and securing Roshan. Arcane Supremacy allows Rubick to cast Hex and Shackles from a safer distance.",
        "[Warlock]: Rubick can easily steal Chaotic Offering, providing a powerful teamfight ability. Cooldown reduction items like Aghanim's Scepter and Octarine Core benefit Rubick by allowing him to frequently summon Warlock's Golem. Telekinesis can interrupt Upheaval and even save allies caught in it. Aghanim's Shard allows Rubick to save allies trapped in Upheaval.",
        "[Puck]: Rubick can make good use of Illusory Orb and Waning Rift for wave-clear and silencing Puck. Stealing Dream Coil is a powerful tool to disable Puck's mobility, forcing her to stay in the danger zone or endure prolonged stuns. Phase Shift allows Rubick to use Blink Dagger effectively.",
        "[Lina]: Rubick gains nuking power from Dragon Slave and crowd control from Light Strike Array. Rubick's faster cast time with Light Strike Array can catch enemies off guard. Stealing Laguna Blade provides Rubick with significant burst damage. Arcane Supremacy enhances the stolen Laguna Blade's damage.",
        "[Grimstroke]: Rubick can use Stroke of Fate for its low cooldown nuke. Phantom's Embrace provides silence and damage, while Ink Swell offers initiation and counter-initiation potential. Stealing Soulbind grants extra crowd control. Telekinesis and Fade Bolt can be applied twice to bound heroes, doubling Fade Bolt's damage.",
        "[Crystal Maiden]: Rubick can use Crystal Nova for farming and area slow. Frostbite extends Rubick's lockdown capabilities and adds extra damage. Freezing Field deals substantial damage with Arcane Supremacy. Rubick can interrupt Freezing Field with well-timed Telekinesis lifts or drops.",
        "[Venomancer]: Rubick benefits from Venomous Gale's ganking and farming capabilities. Plague Ward serves various purposes, including pushing, ganking, farming, and scouting. Poison Nova, when stolen, inflicts a potent damage-over-time debuff. Rubick can easily steal spells from Venomancer due to the difference in cast range.",
        "[Sniper]: Rubick can turn Sniper's abilities against his team. Shrapnel helps with wave-clear and scouting. Stealing Assassinate provides Rubick with a long-range sniping tool, especially potent with Arcane Supremacy and Aghanim's Scepter.",
        "[Juggernaut]: Rubick can utilize Blade Fury for farming and spell immunity. Telekinesis can set up victims for Blade Fury damage. Healing Ward, when stolen, offers excellent healing support. Rubick can steal Omnislash for damage or an escape mechanism.","[Underlord]: Rubick can make good use of Underlord's spell-heavy kit. Firestorm is excellent for farming, pushing, and teamfight damage. Pit of Malice provides strong area control, and Rubick can catch Underlord in it due to his lack of repositioning abilities. Stealing Fiend's Grip offers Rubick's team versatile map movement options.",
        "[Lion]: Earth Spike extends Rubick's crowd control potential, and the increased cast range with Arcane Supremacy helps catch enemies at a greater distance. Hex is a potent single-target lockdown. Mana Drain can solve Rubick's early-game mana regen issues. Stealing Finger of Death enhances Rubick's ganking power.",
        "[Vengeful Spirit]: Magic Missile provides damage and lockdown, and Rubick gains the secondary Magic Missile with Aghanim's Shard. Wave of Terror can be used for scouting and armor reduction in teamfights. Nether Swap allows Rubick to save allies, initiate, or reposition in fights. With Aghanim's Shard, Rubick can choose to disable enemies or save himself after a swap with Telekinesis.",
        "[Pangolier]: Shield Crash helps with farming and Swashbuckle offers mobility and damage. While Rubick lacks Lucky Shot, Swashbuckle can still be a valuable source of damage, especially if Rubick builds attack modifiers. Stealing Rolling Thunder enables Rubick to disrupt teamfights, chain stun enemies, and reposition safely.",
        "[Jakiro]: Jakiro's long cast animations make his abilities easier for Rubick to target. Dual Breath serves as a damage-over-time spell and helps with ganking. Ice Path is an excellent crowd control ability, providing a long-range stun. Macropyre can be a substantial damage source in teamfights and benefits from Arcane Supremacy. It often catches enemies off guard, as they may mistake it for Jakiro's.",
        "[Wraith King]: Rubick can kite Wraith King effectively by using Telekinesis. Fade Bolt mitigates damage from Wraith King's skeletons. Stealing Wraithfire Blast provides Rubick with a reliable stun and harassment tool. Reincarnation can be dealt with by delaying it with Wraithfire Blast. Vampiric Spirit can be useful for summoning skeletons with last hits.","[Enigma]: Rubick can take full advantage of Enigma's Black Hole, a game-changing ultimate. Since Black Hole requires channeling, it's relatively easy for Rubick to steal it. Additionally, Arcane Supremacy can extend Rubick's steal range. Be wary of Enigma's Black King Bar and Linken's Sphere purchases to counter Rubick. Items like Aghanim's Shard, Black King Bar, Aghanim's Scepter, and Refresher Orb can enhance Rubick's use of Black Hole. Malefice can provide damage and stun, while Demonic Conversion aids in pushing and farming. Fade Bolt can mitigate damage from Eidolons and counter-push.",
        "[Phoenix]: Stealing Supernova can be game-changing, allowing Rubick to turn the tide in teamfights. V Telekinesis can help protect the egg from attacks when used right before casting Supernova. Rubick should spam Telekinesis and Fade Bolt before casting Supernova to refresh their cooldowns. Building Aether Lens or Blink Dagger can aid in positioning for successful Supernova steals. It's important to note that Rubick cannot cast Supernova with Aghanim's Shard's Sun Ray, as it takes up two stolen ability slots. Icarus Dive serves as a useful repositioning tool, while Fire Spirits can slow enemy attacks, helping Rubick farm if he has enough HP regeneration. Sun Ray can deal damage to enemies and heal allies, but Rubick can interrupt Icarus Dive and Sun Ray with Telekinesis.",
        "[Witch Doctor]: Rubick can deal significant damage with Witch Doctor's Death Ward, as it requires channeling and Rubick can steal it from outside the attack range. Skilled Witch Doctors may use Voodoo Restoration to disrupt Rubick's spell steal. Telekinesis can interrupt Death Ward and hold enemies in place for potential solo kills. Paralyzing Cask provides additional crowd control, and Maledict can amplify damage taken by enemies. Voodoo Restoration offers some healing utility. Rubick should watch out for Witch Doctor's right-click damage and consider items like Ghost Scepter and Glimmer Cape.",
        "[Shadow Fiend]: Rubick can output substantial crowd damage and control with Shadow Fiend's Requiem of Souls. Arcane Supremacy allows Rubick to steal Requiem of Souls from outside the fear range. Shadow Fiend's cast animation provides Rubick with a clear timing to steal the spell. V Telekinesis can lift an enemy on top of Rubick, forcing them to absorb all lines of Requiem of Souls. Building Blink Dagger is recommended for positioning to cast Requiem of Souls effectively. Shadowraze (Far) offers farming and damage potential. Rubick should be prepared to react quickly to identify which of the three Shadowraze abilities he has stolen. Rubick should also consider items like Ghost Scepter and wards to mitigate Shadow Fiend's right-click damage.",
        "[Undying]: Rubick can counter-initiate with Tombstone, providing vision and making it difficult for Undying to destroy it. Flesh Golem grants Rubick increased health and a powerful attack modifier. Rubick can apply the Flesh Golem debuff more easily as a ranged hero. Decay offers decent damage and makes Rubick tankier in teamfights. Soul Rip can be used for healing or burst damage.",
        "[Magnus]: Stealing Reverse Polarity can turn the tide of teamfights by disrupting Magnus's team. Magnus often positions himself at the center of teamfights after using Reverse Polarity, making him an easy target for Rubick's stolen ultimate. Rubick should be aware that Magnus typically follows up with Skewer or Shockwave, leaving a short window to steal Reverse Polarity. Shockwave aids in farming and provides AoE damage in fights. Empower can be cast on Rubick's team's carry to accelerate farming or amplify damage. Skewer can displace enemies or provide an escape option. Telekinesis can interrupt Magnus's combo when used with Quick Cast enabled.",
        "[Kunkka]: Kunkka's control spells make him an attractive target for Rubick. Stealing Torrent provides additional damage and crowd control. Ghostship is a potent teamfight ability that offers magical damage to enemies and damage negation to allies. Both abilities work well with Rubick's team's control spells, such as Duel. Rubick can reposition an enemy onto a Torrent or Ghostship using Telekinesis. Torrent Storm creates chaos in fights, while Tidal Wave offers control and repositioning. X Marks the Spot serves utility functions, including escape and chase.",
        "[Luna]: Lucent Beam is a reliable magic nuke with a stun. Aghanim's Shard upgraded Lucent Beam provides Rubick with bonus damage. Eclipse can deal massive damage if stolen, especially with Aghanim's Scepter, which extends its range. Building Aghanim's Scepter is recommended for Rubick to maximize Eclipse's effectiveness. Rubick should be aware of Luna's right-click damage and consider items like Ghost Scepter and Glimmer Cape for survivability."

Sand Storm allows Sand King to harass Luna efficiently while staying invisible, making him immune to Lucent Beam and Eclipse. Caustic Finale deals significant damage to Luna and her allies, especially during the laning stage. The combination of Epicenter, Burrowstrike, and Sand Storm can quickly eliminate Luna due to her low health and strength gain. Sand King forces Luna to play defensively and is a potent ally when on the same team.",
        "[Meepo]: Burrowstrike stuns multiple Meepos, making them vulnerable. Epicenter and Sand Storm's AoE damage affects all Meepo clones, making it challenging for Meepo to escape. Sand King should be cautious when using Sand Storm to escape, as Meepo has strong AoE damage and disables that work well against an invisible Sand King.",
